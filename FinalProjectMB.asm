You donâ€™t have the supplies for another night, you must make it to the city. Ahead of you there are two paths, one a well trodden path where light pokes through the trees to the left and another less so trodden path along a creek travelling to the right. " 
    AREA2 .STRINGZ "You follow the path as the trees get thinner and thinner letting more and more light in ahead of you. As you exit the forest, you can clearly see the tall city walls and main gate before you. Leading out of the gate however is a large line of travelers being checked for contraband. You can either go down the left path to this line or try the right path, circling around the walls and possibly finding another entrance."
    AREA3 .STRINGZ "You follow the creak as it grows into a raging river, and as it leads out of the treeline you see the great walls of the city proper on the other side of the river. You could try to brave the river ahead or turn back to face the other path."
    AREA4 .STRINGZ "You finally reach the end of the line, it is gargantuan, you are not even close to the city gate and this could take hours. You can either wait or turn back to try another path"
    AREA5 .STRINGZ "Youâ€™ve reached about halfway around the city and have not spotted another entrance, you see what looks like another entrance ahead but it's another walk around the city. Or you can turn back and try another path."
    AREA6 .STRINGZ "You struggled against the pull of the river until ultimately surrendering to its pull. Some time while being dragged along you lost consciousness and awoke on what appears to be the shore of a lake. Across the lake you see the giant city walls and a break in the walls where you would find the city's port.You could swim across the lake taking a break at an island half way inside the lake or walk around."
    AREA7 .STRINGZ "You come across the edge of the city walls as they open to the grand trading port that opens to the lake. You see as ships pass in and out and a clear spot to enter the city by walking on the boardwalk. You can either continue this path or try another."
    AREA8 .STRINGZ "Youâ€™ve reached the halfway mark, you take a moment to rest and look over at the port. You watch as small vessels enter and leave the port freely. You would be able to freely enter the city if you could make it to the other side. This side is a little further however and the water is getting slightly more turbulent as the day starts to turn to night. You could attempt the last leg of the lake or turn back to find another path."
    AREA9 .STRINGZ "You have reached the safety of the city walls, congratualations you have won the game"
    AREA2back .STRINGZ "You follow the stream back to the river, the same paths are laid out before you. Left to the well trodden path and right to follow the creek"
    AREA4back .STRINGZ "You backtrack to fork in the road. You have the line to your left and the path circling the walls to your right."
    AREA6back .STRINGZ "You backtrack to the beach you woke up on, you can swim across or circle around."
