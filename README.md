# TextBasedGame-CSFINAL-Matthew Barber
## Text based game using LC3-Tools, 
### Uses 1-2 integer options in order to progress, ran into some issues with offset being to far away when using large blocks of code

input has basic check to make sure input is between 1 and two
uses a stack to store addresses of large text, flavor text ment to drive the "adventure"
to improve i would work on getting around the offset limit to create a larger program
